Notes 

- command shift u to see source code    

web.rb = the CONTROLLER that controls the website
	* written in ruby
	* 'require' = include 
	* 'erb :index' : refer to index.erb; this is a function erb( :index) and index.erb is where the html is 
	* look into 
		1. model(this is where you store your data) : in the fb project this was the javascript 
		2. view: HTML static image
		3. controller: this controls how the view changes with respect to the models (in facebook hack, the controller was coded into the html (simple)); web.rb is the controller 

Terminal: 
	* "ctrl c" to quit 
	* 'foreman start' - to start running on localhost:5000 (by default)
	* 'foreman -p 3000 start' (to set port)

	
img = icons and you can use css to get that portion of the image out 

Procfile
	* run by foreman (interprets the Procfile; allows you to run website how Heroku runs it so you know it works) and heroku(server) in order to run the ruby scripts which power your website 
	* Procfile is a mechanism for declaring what commands are run by your applicationâ€™s dynos on the Heroku platform.

Gemfile
	* the gems ~ libraries in C
	* gem 'sinatra', '1.1.0' # helper for sending your website to different client browsers; version number
	* gem 'thin' #includes 3 very useful libraries 

	* bundler takes stuff from this file and it will download it for you
	* bundle install - reads gemfile and installs all those gems listed

Gemfile.lock 
	 * gemfile.lock bundler will keep track of what gems are installed 
	 * gemfile.lock keeps track of the dependencies of the gems 

script.js
	* where the Javascript that interacts with your website is written 
		- make sure JavaScript is enabled in chrome 
		- can be written in the body or head 
		- start with <script type="text/javascript"> ..</script>
		- for external javascript files: <script src="filename"><\script>

index.erb
	<!--this is where you write html for the website; and you can program Javascript into here while referencing to JS-->

bootstrap.min.js
	* bootstrap.js made smaller because everytime website is initally loaded, this file is accessed
